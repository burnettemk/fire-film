RatingRadio.tsx - This will be deleted soon in favor of an OR selection control
RatingSelection.tsx - I want the drawer to close on changing the value. But I should probably implement an OR selection control instead and
                        wait for the user to click an 'Apply' button or to close the drawer.
MovieGridDisplay.tsx + TVGridDisplay - I need to have consistent spacing for these two grid displays
RatingList.tsx - Will be a list displaying the current available ratings depending on the country of the user
    - get a list of ratings by country code
    - display the list of ratings with selectable buttons
    - describe desired button theme in theme.ts
    - implement theme if time permits it
    - use onClick events for each button to call a function that saves changes as local state
    - call setCertification() to update the state of the app and query new data
