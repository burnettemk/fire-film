RatingRadio.tsx - This will be deleted soon in favor of an OR selection control
RatingSelection.tsx - I want the drawer to close on changing the value. But I should probably implement an OR selection control instead and
                        wait for the user to click an 'Apply' button or to close the drawer.
MovieGridDisplay.tsx + TVGridDisplay - I need to have consistent spacing for these two grid displays
RatingList.tsx - Will be a list displaying the current available ratings depending on the country of the user
    - get a list of ratings by country code
        - find a way to use variables to reference the desired property
    - describe desired button theme in theme.ts
    - implement theme if time permits it
SelectionList.tsx - Add an 'Apply Changes' button so query doesn't happen immediately
