/*
 * Spacing pattern
 *
 *  Simple Grid:
 *    Possible Pixel Spacings:
 *      [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 64, ..., 100]
 *
 *    Margin set to Auto to center it in page (page is the context)
 *      2560px - 128px
 *      1440px - 72px
 *      1024px - 51.2px
 *      768px - 38.4px
 *      425px - 21.275px
 *      375px - 18.762px
 *      320px - 16px
 *    Padding is set to 4em which only is fixed to 64 px by being set as 'base' padding size
 *      The edge of the container is not clearly defined and so cannot be easily seen.
 *      However, a margin of auto with width set to 90% and havign only 1 column makes for
 *      huge image with low resolution, which looks bad.
 *      I like for there to be padding and a padding of 64px isn't bad. Looks good on mobile
 *        Express in ems: 64 / 1519.2, 64/320
 *
