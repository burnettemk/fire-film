Nothing can get done in this app without the proper ids
Find the ids and then you can use them in your queries
Test if useData stills works even if we give it an object with more properties than needed

Don't worry about having a perfect solution right now, you need to focus on getting the job done.
Trying to find the perfect solution would be a distraction from our goal. We can always refactor
later.
